## 1. What is PL/SQL
PL/SQL stands for “Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language”.

SQL is a popular language for both querying and updating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

PL/SQL adds many procedural constructs to SQL language to overcome some limitations of SQL. In addition, PL/SQL provides a more comprehensive programming language solution for building mission-critical applications on Oracle Databases.

PL/SQL is an embedded language. PL/SQL only can be executed in an Oracle Database. It was not designed to be used as a standalone language like Java, C#, and C++. In other words, you cannot develop a PL/SQL program that runs on a system that does not have an Oracle Database.

### PL/SQL architecture

In this architecture, the PL/SQL engine compiles PL/SQL code into byte-code and executes the executable code. The PL/SQL engine can only be installed in an Oracle Database server or an application development tool such as Oracle Forms.

Once you submit a PL/SQL block to the Oracle Database server, the PL/SQL engine collaborates with the SQL engine to compile and execute the code. PL/SQL engine runs the procedural elements while the SQL engine processes the SQL statements.
