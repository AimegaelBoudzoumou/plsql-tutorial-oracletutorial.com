A PL/SQL record is a composite data structure that consists of multiple fields; each has its own value. The following picture shows an example record that includes first name, last name, email, and phone number:

PL/SQL record helps you simplify your code by shifting from field-level to record-level operations.

PL/SQL has three types of records: table-based, cursor-based, and programmer-defined. Before using a record, you must declare it.

Declaring records
You define and declare records in the declaration section of a block or via package specification.
