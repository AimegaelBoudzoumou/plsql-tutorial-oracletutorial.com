# Anonymous Block

PL/SQL is a block-structured language whose code is organized into blocks. 

A block consists of three sections:

- Declaration
- Executable
- Exception-handling

In a block, the executable section is mandatory while the declaration and exception-handling sections are optional.

A PL/SQL block has a name. Functions or Procedures is an example of a named block. A named block is stored in the Oracle Database server and can be reusable later.

A block without a name is an anonymous block. An anonymous block is not saved in the Oracle Database server, so it is just for one-time use.

The following picture illustrates the structure of a PL/SQL block:
