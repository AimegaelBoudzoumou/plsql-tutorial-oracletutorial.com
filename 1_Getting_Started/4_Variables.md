# Variables

In PL/SQL, a variable is named storage location that stores a value of a particular data type. The value of the variable changes through the program. Before using a variable, you must declare it in the declaration section of a block.

## Declaring variables
The syntax for a variable declaration is as follows:
```sql
variable_name datatype [NOT NULL] [:= initial_value];
```
